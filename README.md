# osrs-combat-simulator
An attempt to create a tick by tick combat simulator in Old School Runescape

This project is inspired by the simulation work the most excellent Molgoatkirby has done in regard to discovering optimal setups for acheiving record times.
Creating a DPS calculator alone is something that has been done many times, such as the the venerable google sheet made by Bitterkoekje, or the more recent OSRS Wiki webapp.
However, simulating tick-by-tick damage on bosses with various mechanics such as invulnerability phases is something that seems way outside the scope of those projects, as they need to be useable for the vast majority of players.

Additionally, I also know next to nothing about proper Python deveopment so this will be a good excersise in at least writing (hopefully) legible code.
